# Task Management

## 📋 Current Tasks

### 🔥 High Priority
- [ ] **Refactor server.py** (2024-01-21)
  - Split 1182-line file into smaller modules (<500 lines each)
  - Separate concerns: endpoints, middleware, models, utils
  
- [x] **Create unit tests** (2024-01-21) ✅
  - Set up pytest framework in `/tests` folder
  - Mirror app structure for test organization
  - Test coverage for RAG agent, auth, and core endpoints
  - Added requirements-dev.txt with pytest dependencies

### 🚀 Performance & Reliability  
- [x] **Fix 504 Gateway Timeout** (2024-01-21) ✅
  - Added OpenAI API timeouts (30s default)
  - Added agent execution timeouts (45s default)
  - Added RAG retrieve timeouts (15s default)
  - Implemented graceful error handling

- [x] **Optimize performance** (2024-01-21) ✅
  - Increased agent caching from 32 to 256 instances
  - Added RAG result caching with 5-minute TTL
  - Lowered async history threshold from 80 to 20 messages
  - Optimized conversation cleanup with batching

### 🧹 Code Quality
- [ ] **Add docstrings** (2024-01-21)
  - Google-style docstrings for all public functions
  - Type hints for all function parameters and returns
  
- [ ] **Fix linting issues** (2024-01-21)
  - Address Pylance warnings about unused variables
  - Clean up imports and remove dead code

### 📚 Documentation
- [x] **Create project structure docs** (2024-01-21) ✅
  - Added CLAUDE.md with development guidelines
  - Added PLANNING.md with architecture overview
  - Added TASK.md for task tracking

- [ ] **Update README.md** (2024-01-21)
  - Document new environment variables
  - Add performance optimization settings
  - Include deployment instructions

## 🔍 Discovered During Work

### Performance Optimization Session (2024-01-21)
- **Issue**: 504 Gateway Timeout errors on `/chat` endpoint
- **Root Cause**: No timeouts on OpenAI API calls and RAG operations
- **Solution**: Comprehensive timeout management with fallbacks

### Code Quality Issues Found
- `app/api/server.py` is 1182 lines (violates 500-line rule)
- Multiple Pylance warnings about unused variables
- Missing unit tests for critical components
- Some functions lack proper docstrings

### Environment Variables Added
```bash
OPENAI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
RAG_AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=45
RAG_RETRIEVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=15
RAG_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=300
RAG_HISTORY_ASYNC_THRESHOLD=20
```
